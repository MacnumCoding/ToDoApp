## This Project
This project is a small attempt at learning and using Java, and will most likely remain as is, as further attempts at Java will come in
the form of other, hopefully, bigger projects.

## Potential Future Improvement
Disclaimer: This is primarily meant for thoughtprocess on how this project could become more complex, rather than optimized, as a means to learn Java.
Switch to keeping data on a file so it may persist, thoughts on this:
- Should ToDo entries shift ID's on removed entry to maintain seqential order? or should new entries fill those gaps?
- Would additional data be needed to maintain a proper ToDo list? date/time, priority level etc.
Can this project be built for desktop purposes? should it still operate through terminal?
